# Globals Library

Just some files with common functions that I set up in a global directory for usage.

To use, place in a folder and add to [PHP's include_path](http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.include-path).

Then just include them in your scripts with a simple include or require.

```php
include('lib.email.php');
```
